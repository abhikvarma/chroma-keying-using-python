# chroma-keying-using-python
the code relies on skimage, a python toolkit, to perform imaging operations in order to:
* remove a green background from an image while isolating an object
* blend two images into a single image after applying basic rotation, translation and scale operations
* apply gaussian blur filter on background image
* save image on disk
